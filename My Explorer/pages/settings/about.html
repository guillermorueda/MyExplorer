                <h3>Developer</h3>
                <p>I created this app for fun, in my free time and my idea behind it is to give it to the people for everyone to use. I'll keep improving it and adding more functionality.</p>
                <p>My Explorer is free of payment and ads and I'm planning on keeping it always like this.</p>

                <h3>My Explorer</h3>
                <p>This is a modern version of the desktop's File Explorer.</p>
                <p>Why "My" Explorer? Because it does not only give you access to browse and manage all your files and folders in a touch first way, it also allows you to make it personal. You can make it yours by having your own favorites at hand and allowing you to pin to Start any folder, so that it is always very easy to reach those locations in a simple and friendly few steps.</p>
