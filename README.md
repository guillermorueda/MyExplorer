Why "My" Explorer? Because it does not only give you access to browse and manage all your files and folders in a touch first way, it also allows you to make it personal. You can make it yours by having your own favorites at hand and allowing you to pin to Start any folder, so that it is always very easy to reach those locations in a simple and friendly few steps.

Restrictions to all Windows 8 applications that affect My Explorer: The following folders are not accessible to any Windows 8 application: System folders (i.e. program files); hidden and protected folders and files; executable files (i.e. exe, js)
It is not possible to launch files that depend on other files (i.e. complete webpages, the ones that save an html file and a folder with its images).
